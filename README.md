# Predictive Modeling Project README

## Overview
This README document provides an overview of the predictive modeling project using real estate data. The project includes steps like exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, splitting the data, model selection, training, and result evaluation.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- category_encoders
- scikit-learn
- scipy

Ensure you have Python installed on your system and the necessary libraries mentioned above.

## Dataset
The dataset includes real estate listings with features like housing status, beds, baths, property size, city, state, zip code, house size, previous sold date, and price. The dataset was loaded and processed for model fitting.

## File Descriptions
- `Predictive_modeling.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing all the code for data loading, cleaning, analysis, modeling, and evaluation.

## Instructions
1. Load the data using pandas and perform initial explorations.
2. Clean the dataset by handling missing values, removing outliers, and encoding categorical variables.
3. Split the data into training and testing sets.
4. Train various models including Linear Regression, ElasticNet, Random Forest, and GradientBoostingRegressor.
5. Evaluate the models based on Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R2-Score.
6. Present the results in a comparative format.

## Results
The project demonstrates the efficacy of various regression models in predicting real estate prices. The Random Forest model showed the best performance in terms of all the evaluation metrics used.

## Conclusion
The analysis highlights important insights and the effectiveness of different predictive models. The process outlined in the Jupyter notebook can be adapted for similar types of predictive modeling tasks.
